# YTXI
**YTXI is an extension for youtube-dl [(original youtube-dl repository)](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)**
**on 22.11.2022 was updated to use YTB-DL [(original ytb-dl repository)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)**

This is how the program looks after it is launched (a tooltip on top of your screen):

You need FFMPEG bin package and lame_enc.dll, download those from here:

> - [FFMPEG](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/4.4) (for the video formats)
> - [lame_enc.dll](https://www.dll-files.com/lame_enc.dll.html) (for the mp3 format)

After you finish setting it up the entire path should look like this :

 **YTXI folder :**
 - ffmpeg.exe
 - ffplay.exe
 - ffprobe.exe
 - lame_enc.dll
 - youtube-dl.exe
 - YTXI by blankode.exe (YTXI by blankode.au3 is not needed as it is the source code)
